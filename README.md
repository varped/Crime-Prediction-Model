ECS 111 Final project: Forecasting Crime with Contextual Features

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook for our ECS 111 Final Project. We built a machine learning pipeline to forecast crime in San Francisco using spatial, temporal, and environmental data.

## Files
- `Crime_Prediction_Project_CLEANED.ipynb`: Full modeling pipeline with cleaned dataset, EDA, and building predictive model
- `Crime_Prediction_HeatMap_Final`: A visual and interactive heatmap of the crime predictions in SF based on our best predictive model.
- Access to our Interactive HeatMap based on our Model: (https://varped.github.io/Crime-Prediction-Model/Crime_Prediction_HeatMap_Final.html)
